# RFS2023
Files for the summer school on risk finance and stochastics 2023

During the R session we make use of the following packages: BallMapper, datasauRus, ggplot2, dplyr, crypto2

The first half of the session considers how Topological Data Analysis Ball Mapper (TDABM) may be used to map the datasauRus datasets. We show that even in the small sample environments of the "datasaurus dozen", TDABM is able to recover information on the shape of the datasets. 

The second half of the session considers return to 5 cryptocurrencies. For the second session there are user defined functions which are employed to generate lists of points which sit within the balls of the TDABM plot. We discuss the elements of a TDABM plot and how user defined functions can be built on top of the main elements of the BallMapper package.

All questions on this session should be addressed to me via my university email.
